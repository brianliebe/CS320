What Works: Everything
What Doesn't Work: Nothing

Extra Credit: 

I implemented a least frequently used (LFU)replacement 
policy for the extra credit. When a tag is found, I add
it to a vector, and set its frequency to 1. When it is
accessed again, I increase the frequency. When deciding
which tags to replace, I choose the tag that corresponds
to the lowest frequency. I found that this is more 
efficient than both other replacement policies under the
correct cicumstances/program.
