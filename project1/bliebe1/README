Explanation of Extra Credit:

The idea doesn't really work in practice, but I think it could work in theory.

1. Creates a table which contains a sort of tagging (name of address and a value 0-3)
2. Fills a vector up to a certain size, until it is full with the first addresses.
3. Once full, the oldest values will start being replaced if they haven't been used recently.
4. Addresses used recently will be re-added with the value changed depending on the branch result.

So it works similar to the bimodal, two-bit design, except entries are removed if they're old.
It does take a while to run, however, but a better implementation could yield decent results.

I'm defaulting it to a 16-entry table (which is way too small) because it takes a very small amount
of time to run. In theory, it would work much better at 2048 entries, but this takes much too long 
to run, and therefore won't work with this submission (since you guys need to run the program and
have it not take 20 mins).
